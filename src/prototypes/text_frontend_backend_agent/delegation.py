"""The frontend's only tool: ``call_backend``.

There is deliberately no cancel/discard tool. Under a turn-based API there is
no reachable path on which the frontend could fire one: internal execution
blocks until the backend turn completes, and in external execution a user
message arriving while tool results are outstanding is intercepted by the
driver-level ``on_user_message_while_pending`` policy before the frontend LLM
is ever called.
