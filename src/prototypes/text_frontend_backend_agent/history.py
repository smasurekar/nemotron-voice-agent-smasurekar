"""Group-aware conversation history with tool-call-safe pruning.

A flat sliding window over messages can separate an assistant tool-call batch
from its tool results, which most providers reject outright. History is
therefore modelled as *logical groups*::

    Group = user message
          + assistant message (text, or a tool-call batch)
          [+ all tool results for that batch
           + the assistant continuation (text, or another batch -> repeat)]

Pruning drops whole groups, oldest first, and never splits one. System prompts
are not stored here at all (they are rendered at call time), so "pinned" is
structural rather than a special case.
