and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.2.0] - TBD

This minor release adds Nemotron 3.5 Lightning and Nemotron 3 Nano Omni support, universal `*/single-gpu` recipes with the NeMo-Speech.cpp stack, an OpenAI Realtime-compatible WebSocket gateway, and the `nemotron-voice-agent-builder` skill. It consolidates on-prem deployment under `*/server` and `*/single-gpu`, upgrades Pipecat to 1.7.0, and removes the platform-specific recipes and Nemotron 3 Nano cascaded LLM.

### Added

- **Nemotron 3.5 Lightning** NIM and vLLM sidecars. Single-GPU recipes load the NVFP4 checkpoint on supported GPUs. Blackwell, DGX Spark, and Jetson Thor serve native NVFP4, with DSpark speculative decoding on DGX Spark and DFlash on Blackwell workstations. Hopper and Ada serve the same NVFP4 checkpoint as W4A16 through Marlin.
- **Nemotron 3 Nano Omni NIM** for the Omni `*/server` recipes.
- **`*/single-gpu` recipes** running the NeMo-Speech.cpp speech stack next to vLLM on one GPU across all examples.
- **`scripts/download-nemo-speech-models.sh`** for one-time NeMo-Speech.cpp GGUF setup on single-GPU hosts.
- **OpenAI Realtime–compatible WebSocket gateway** (`WS /v1/realtime`) that drives the existing cascaded ASR → LLM → TTS pipelines for OpenAI Realtime–shaped clients, with NVIDIA-only knobs under `session.nvidia`.
- **`nemotron-voice-agent-builder` agent skill** for scaffolding and refining NVIDIA voice agents (cascaded or Omni) across Pipecat, LiveKit, and custom frameworks.
- Optional `NvidiaWordTTSService` for Magpie word streaming and timestamp-based context commits.

### Changed

- Serve Nemotron 3.5 Lightning NVFP4 as W4A16 through Marlin on Hopper and Ada single-GPU hosts, instead of a BF16 checkpoint with online FP8.
- Upgraded Pipecat to version 1.7.0.
- Set **Nemotron 3.5 Lightning** as the default LLM across cascaded examples. Nemotron 3 Super remains available in the service catalogs.
- Standardized the self-hosted Nemotron 3.5 Lightning served model ID with NVIDIA Cloud across NIM and single-GPU vLLM deployments.
- Consolidated on-prem deployment recipes under `<example>/server` for scaling-oriented stacks and universal `<example>/single-gpu` for supported one-GPU deployments on workstations, DGX Spark, and Jetson Thor. Renamed `generic-assistant/workstation-perf` to `generic-assistant/server-perf`.
- Replaced `PLATFORM`-based local service selection with endpoint reachability.
- Gated the NVIDIA Cloud (NVCF) service catalog on `NVIDIA_API_KEY`, so those entries appear in the UI and pipeline only when a cloud key is set.
- Updated Nemotron ASR Streaming NIM to version 1.3.1.
- Updated Parakeet CTC 1.1B ASR NIM to version 1.5.3.
- Updated Magpie TTS Multilingual NIM to version 1.10.0 and `nvidia-riva-client` to version 2.27.0.
- Renamed the Magpie Multilingual Compose services to `magpie-multilingual-tts-service` and `magpie-multilingual-tts-service-perf`.
- Updated Chatterbox TTS Multilingual NIM to version 1.1.0 and documented its available model profiles.
- Updated the React UI client to `@pipecat-ai/client-react` 1.8.2 and rendered the conversation transcript directly from Pipecat's `usePipecatConversation()` hook, removing the custom client-side turn reconstruction and timestamp re-anchoring.
- Relicensed the repository from BSD-2-Clause to a dual CC-BY-4.0 and Apache-2.0 license.

### Fixed

- Cap Omni NIM KV cache (`NIM_KVCACHE_PERCENT` default `0.6`, `NIM_MAX_MODEL_LEN` `32768`) so Magpie TTS can share GPU 0.
- Emit `user-turn-finalized` from Omni Assistant Subagents so the server signals user-turn boundaries.
- Keep chat transcripts in speaking order by rendering the Pipecat SDK message stream directly instead of merging server- and client-derived timestamps, which could reorder turns under clock skew.
- Render each bot turn as a single transcript bubble instead of splitting multi-sentence responses into separate messages.
- Show the negotiated RTVI protocol version in the Session panel instead of the client library version.
- Resolve shared TTS voice ids (`John`) against the catalog default language so the disabled language dropdown shows `en-US` instead of the alphabetically first locale.

### Removed

- Platform-specific **`*/workstation`, `*/dgx-spark`, and `*/jetson-thor` recipes** and the Jetson Riva sidecars (`nemotron-speech`, `nemotron-speech-tts`), along with the CUDA MPS helper scripts, CPU-pinning knobs, and `RIVA_*` environment knobs. Use `*/server`, `generic-assistant/server-perf`, or `*/single-gpu` instead.
- **Nemotron 3 Nano** cascaded LLM catalog entries and its NIM compose file. Use Nemotron 3.5 Lightning instead.
- **NVIDIA Cloud (NVCF) catalog entries** for Nemotron 3 Super (`nemotron-super`, `nemotron-super-reasoning`) and Parakeet CTC 1.1B (`parakeet-ctc`). Both models remain available self-hosted.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-08-21

Patch release replacing the deprecated Nemotron 3 Nano cloud endpoint in cascaded pipelines.

### Changed

- Replaced the deprecated Nemotron 3 Nano cloud endpoint with Nemotron 3.5 Lightning across cascaded NVIDIA Cloud service catalogs and defaults.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-08-18

Minor release with expanded TTS options, improved turn-taking, Omni Assistant Subagents refinements, multilingual model compatibility checks, and broader evaluation coverage.

### Added

- Chatterbox TTS Multilingual with 23 languages and Magpie TTS Zeroshot with optional voice cloning.
- Omni Assistant webcam steering, thinker reasoning, and subagent handoff improvements.
- Pipecat evaluation coverage for core examples, latency, and tool scenarios.

### Changed

- Updated Magpie TTS Multilingual NIM to version 1.9.0 and documented its 12 supported languages.
- Upgraded Pipecat to **1.5.0** and refreshed NIM, vLLM, and CVE-related dependency pins.
- Improved Smart Turn defaults and added inactivity checks for the Generic Assistant.
- Refactored `NvidiaOmniLLMService` on Pipecat's `NvidiaLLMService` base.
- Grouped sentence-level bot output into turn-level transcript messages across all examples.

### Fixed

- Improved Omni Assistant Subagents media handling.
- Restricted multilingual sessions to supported ASR, TTS, and LLM combinations.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-09

Re-architecture by upstreaming `nvidia-pipecat` changes to [Pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat) and a unified React UI client, new multimodal Nemotron Omni and Frontend Backend Agent examples and recipe-style deployment profiles.

### Added

- **Example pipelines**, each shipped as self-contained Compose recipes:
  - `generic-assistant`: baseline English cascaded pipeline (Nemotron ASR + LLM + Magpie TTS).
  - `multilingual-assistant`: showcases a multilingual pipeline using Multilingual ASR and TTS, with a fixed language per session for better reliability.
  - `omni-assistant`: Nemotron 3 Nano Omni as a single multimodal ASR + LLM service with Magpie TTS.
  - `omni-assistant-subagents`: the Omni service split across cooperating Pipecat Subagents with live webcam, vision and uploaded-media analysis.
  - `frontend-backend-agent`: a talker LLM front-ending a stateful backend agent (airline-booking reference).
- `NvidiaOmniLLMService`: an upstream-compatible Pipecat `LLMService` for Nemotron Omni
- **Unified UI client** (`client/`) with grouped LLM/ASR/TTS selectors (Self-hosted / NVIDIA Cloud / Custom), a prompt-preset picker, a Metrics panel, attachment upload, and a webcam panel.
- **New models**: Nemotron 3 Super 120B A12B and Nemotron 3 Nano Omni (LLMs), plus Nemotron ASR Streaming (English and Multilingual).
- **DGX Spark and single-GPU workstation** local NIM deployment, plus improved Jetson Thor support.
- Agent skills for example deployments and configurations.

### Fixed

- Improve TTS text filter to avoid removing commonly used special chars like $, %
- Summarize chat history for long sessions to limit LLM context growth.

### Changed

- Pipecat is used directly and upgraded **0.0.98 → 1.3.0**.
- Enabled Pipecat smart turn detection model as default turn taking solution replacing Silero VAD based silence EOU.
- **Recipe-style Compose profiles**: `<example>` (cloud-only) and `<example>/<hardware>` (on-prem, for example `generic-assistant/dgx-spark`, `omni-assistant/jetson-thor`). Each is a complete, self-contained stack. `tracing` (Phoenix OTel) and `turn` (Coturn) remain optional overlays.

### Removed

- `nvidia-pipecat` Git submodule (NVIDIA Services Upstreamed to Pipecat directly).
- The previous `frontend/` WebRTC and WebSocket UIs, replaced by the React `client/` in the Pipecat-based re-architecture.
- Speculative speech processing (`ENABLE_SPECULATIVE_SPEECH`), the latency optimization that used intermediate ASR transcripts.
- Legacy configuration environment variables (per-slot `DEFAULT_*`, `DEPLOYMENT_PLATFORM`, pipeline-shaping CLI flags, and example-specific service URLs). Configuration now lives in the example service catalogs and `examples_registry.yaml`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-03

### Known Issues

- ASR transcription can occasionally be inaccurate, though the LLM generally compensates by inferring meaning from context.
- The context aggregator limits chat history to 20 turns by default. Older turns are dropped when this limit is reached, rather than summarized.
